"Enhancing credit scoring with alternative data","Using email usage and psychometric variables, along with demographic data, can improve credit scoring accuracy for new accounts when conventional credit history data is unavailable.","V. Djeundje, J. Crook, R. Calabrese, Mona Hamid",2021,51,"Abstract Hundreds of millions of people in low-income economies do not have a credit or bank account because they have insufficient credit history for a credit score to be ascribed to them. In this paper we evaluate the predictive accuracy of models using alternative data, that may be used instead of credit history, to predict the credit risk of a new account. Without alternative data, the type of data that is typically available is demographic data. We show that a model that contains email usage and psychometric variables, as well as demographic variables, can give greater predictive accuracy than a model that uses demographic data only and that the predictive accuracy is sufficiently high for the demographic and email data to be used when conventional credit history data is unavailable. The same applies if merely psychometric data is included together with demographic data. However, we show that different randomly selected training: test sample splits give a wide range of predictive accuracies. In the second part of the paper, using two datasets that include only email usage as a predictor, we compare the predictive performances of a wide range of machine learning and statistical classifiers. We find that some classifiers applied to these alternative predictors give sufficiently accurate predictions for these variables to be used when no other data is available.","","Expert Syst.

"The value of big data for credit scoring: Enhancing financial inclusion using mobile phone data and social network analytics","Adding call-detail records and social network analytics to credit scoring models significantly improves model performance and profitability, with the best model built solely on calling behavior features.","M. Óskarsdóttir, Cristián Bravo, Carlos Sarraute, J. Vanthienen, B. Baesens",2019,119,"Abstract Credit scoring is without a doubt one of the oldest applications of analytics. In recent years, a multitude of sophisticated classification techniques have been developed to improve the statistical performance of credit scoring models. Instead of focusing on the techniques themselves, this paper leverages alternative data sources to enhance both statistical and economic model performance. The study demonstrates how including call networks, in the context of positive credit information, as a new Big Data source has added value in terms of profit by applying a profit measure and profit-based feature selection. A unique combination of datasets, including call-detail records, credit and debit account information of customers is used to create scorecards for credit card applicants. Call-detail records are used to build call networks and advanced social network analytics techniques are applied to propagate influence from prior defaulters throughout the network to produce influence scores. The results show that combining call-detail records with traditional data in credit scoring models significantly increases their performance when measured in AUC. In terms of profit, the best model is the one built with only calling behavior features. In addition, the calling behavior features are the most predictive in other models, both in terms of statistical and economic performance. The results have an impact in terms of ethical use of call-detail records, regulatory implications, financial inclusion, as well as data sharing and privacy.","","ArXiv","1","10.1016/j.asoc.2018.10.004","https://consensus.app/papers/value-data-credit-scoring-enhancing-inclusion-using-phone-%C3%B3skarsd%C3%B3ttir/0fd924d905305cd787c1e7205e2e301b/"
"Spatiotemporal Integration of Mobile, Satellite, and Public Geospatial Data for Enhanced Credit Scoring","Integrating mobile-phone, satellite, and public geospatial data significantly improves credit scoring for financially excluded individuals, leading to greater financial inclusion and cost savings for financial institutions.","Naomi Simumba, Suguru Okami, A. Kodaka, N. Kohtake",2021,5,"Credit scoring of financially excluded persons is challenging for financial institutions because of a lack of financial data and long physical distances, which hamper data collection. The remote collection of alternative data has the potential to overcome these challenges, enabling credit access for such individuals. Whereas alternative data sources such as mobile phones have been investigated by previous researchers, this research proposes the integration of mobile-phone, satellite, and public geospatial data to improve credit evaluations where financial data are lacking. An approach to integrating these disparate data sources involving both spatial and temporal analysis methods such as spatial aggregation was employed, resulting in various data combinations. The resulting data sets were used to train classifiers of varying complexity, from logistic regression to ensemble learning. Comparisons were based on various performance metrics, including accuracy and the area under the receiver operating-characteristic curve. The combination of all three data sources performed significantly better than mobile-phone data, with the mean classifier accuracy and F1 score improving by 18% and 0.149, respectively. It is shown how these improvements can translate to cost savings for financial institutions through a reduction in misclassification errors. Alternative data combined in this manner could enhance credit provision to financially excluded persons while managing associated risks, leading to greater financial inclusion.","","Symmetry","2","10.3390/SYM13040575","https://consensus.app/papers/integration-mobile-satellite-public-geospatial-data-simumba/9b907666f8cd581b8cc0e483d6545979/"
"Using data mining to improve assessment of credit worthiness via credit scoring models","Data mining techniques can improve credit scoring models, identifying potential defaulters in recreational club payments.","B. W. Yap, S. Ong, Nor Huselina Mohamed Husain",2011,176,"Credit scoring model have been developed by banks and researchers to improve the process of assessing credit worthiness during the credit evaluation process. The objective of credit scoring models is to assign credit risk to either a ''good risk'' group that is likely to repay financial obligation or a ''bad risk'' group who has high possibility of defaulting on the financial obligation. Construction of credit scoring models requires data mining techniques. Using historical data on payments, demographic characteristics and statistical techniques, credit scoring models can help identify the important demographic characteristics related to credit risk and provide a score for each customer. This paper illustrates using data mining to improve assessment of credit worthiness using credit scoring models. Due to privacy concerns and unavailability of real financial data from banks this study applies the credit scoring techniques using data of payment history of members from a recreational club. The club has been facing a problem of rising number in defaulters in their monthly club subscription payments. The management would like to have a model which they can deploy to identify potential defaulters. The classification performance of credit scorecard model, logistic regression model and decision tree model were compared. The classification error rates for credit scorecard model, logistic regression and decision tree were 27.9%, 28.8% and 28.1%, respectively. Although no model outperforms the other, scorecards are relatively much easier to deploy in practical applications.","","Expert Syst.

"Poster: A Scoping Review of Alternative Credit Scoring Literature","Alternative credit scoring, using non-financial data like digital footprints and psychometric data, can accelerate financial inclusion for 'credit invisibles' in developing economies.","R. Njuguna, Karen Sowon",2021,5,"This paper covers a scoping review to establish the breadth of alternative credit scoring literature. The field is nascent and gaining popularity due to the crucial role alternative data is playing to accelerate financial inclusion. Historically, evaluating creditworthiness required availability of past financial activity such as loan repayment. Such stringent requirements rendered people with little or no financial history ‘credit invisible’. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have enabled scoring algorithms to work with non-financial data such as digital footprints from mobile devices and psychometric data to compute credit scores. Although the largest portion of ‘credit invisibles’ are in developing economies, research in the area is predominantly originating from developed economies and most alternative credit scoring models are trained with data from developed economies. There is need for more research from developing contexts and utilization of alternative data from populations with a smaller digital footprint.","literature review","ACM SIGCAS Conference on Computing and Sustainable Societies","","10.1145/3460112.3471972","https://consensus.app/papers/poster-scoping-review-alternative-credit-scoring-njuguna/0a9a363f34125c78aa9be0fa19cbe590/"
"Research on personal credit scoring model based on multi-source data","This paper proposes a weighted average model using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Catboost, which effectively models personal credit situations, indicating lower credit risk for customers with long credit histories and good credit behavior.","Haichao Zhang, Ruishuang Zeng, Lin-long Chen, Shan-shan Zhang",2020,5,"In the Internet financial personal credit loan business, it is necessary to construct a credit scoring model for users, and the problems of unbalanced user categories, high data dimensions and sparse features make it difficult to model the credit situation of users. This paper adopts the idea of grouping modeling. It proposes an improved BIV value feature screening method and a weighted average model based on Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Catboost, which provides a set of solutions for user modeling in this scenario. The grouping modeling idea pre-groups the customers and reduces the feature sparsity problem. The improved BIV value shows the influence of each feature on the results and points out the mutation threshold. The oversampling method alleviates the category imbalance problem. AUC is used as the model result evaluation index, and the results show that the classification effect of the model is good. The results show that customers with a long history of credit history and a history of good credit behavior have lower credit risk.","","Journal of Physics: Conference Series","","10.1088/1742-6596/1437/1/012053","https://consensus.app/papers/research-credit-scoring-model-based-multisource-data-zhang/b922edaabe3f57b0ad0840be71560a38/"
"A novel multi-stage ensemble model with enhanced outlier adaptation for credit scoring","The proposed multi-stage ensemble model with enhanced outlier adaptation outperforms existing models in credit scoring, achieving good predictive power and reducing the adverse effects of outliers in noisy datasets.","Wenyu Zhang, Dongqi Yang, Shuai Zhang, J. Ablanedo-Rosas, Xin Wu, Yu Lou",2021,38,"Abstract Credit and credit-based transactions underlie the financial system. After decades of development, artificial intelligence and machine learning have brought new momentum to the credit scoring model. In this study, a novel multi-stage ensemble model with enhanced outlier adaptation is proposed to achieve good predictive power for credit scoring. To reduce the adverse effects of outliers existing in the noise-filled credit datasets, a local outlier factor algorithm is enhanced with the bagging strategy to effectively identify outliers and subsequently boost them back into the training set to construct an outlier-adapted training set that enhances the outlier adaptability of base classifiers. To improve the feature interpretability, a new dimension-reduced feature transformation method is proposed to hierarchically evolve features and extract salient features. To further strengthen the predictive power of the proposed model, a stacking-based ensemble learning method with self-adaptive parameter optimization is proposed to optimize the parameters of selected base classifiers automatically and then to construct a stacking-based multi-stage ensemble model. Ten datasets are tested with six evaluation indicators to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results including statistical test results indicate the superior performance of the proposed model and prove its significance and effectiveness.","","Expert Syst.

"A Deep Learning Based Online Credit Scoring Model for P2P Lending","The online integrated credit scoring model (OICSM) significantly improves performance in P2P lending by integrating gradient boosting decision tree and neural network, and enables online dynamic update capability.","Zaimei Zhang, Kun Niu, Yan Liu",2020,18,"Credit scoring models have been widely used in traditional financial institutions for many years. Using these models in P2P Lending have limitations. First, the credit data of P2P usually contains dense numerical features and sparse categorical features. Second, the existing credit scoring models are generally cannot be updated online. The loan transaction of P2P lending is very frequent and the new data leads data distribution to change. A credit scoring model without considering data update causes a serious deviation or even failure in subsequent credit assessment. In this paper, we propose a new online integrated credit scoring model (OICSM) for P2P Lending. OICSM integrates gradient boosting decision tree and neural network to make the credit scoring model can handle two types of features more effectively and update online. Offline and online experiments based on real and representative credit datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that OICSM can significantly improve performance due to its advantage in deep learning over two features, and it can further correct model deterioration due to its online dynamic update capability.","","IEEE Access","1","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027337","https://consensus.app/papers/deep-learning-based-online-credit-scoring-model-lending-zhang/4345073f60045f9393e784268451da35/"
"A novel ensemble method for credit scoring: Adaption of different imbalance ratios","The novel ensemble model for credit scoring, adapted to different imbalance ratio datasets, provides superior performance and high robustness, outperforming other comparative algorithms.","Hongliang He, Wenyu Zhang, Shuai Zhang",2018,173,"Abstract In the past few decades, credit scoring has become an increasing concern for financial institutions and is currently a popular topic of research. This study aims to generate a novel ensemble model for credit scoring, to obtain superior performance and high robustness, adapting to different imbalance ratio datasets. First, according to the credit scoring data characteristics, the proposed model extends the BalanceCascade approach to generate adjustable balanced subsets based on the imbalance ratios of training data. Further, it reduces the negative effect of imbalanced data and improves the comprehensive performance of the predictive model. Second, the proposed model adopts two kinds of tree-based classifiers, random forest and extreme gradient boosting, as the base classifiers for a three-stage ensemble model. This includes the use of stacking to generate predicted results of the former layer as new explanatory features in the latter layer, and the use of a particle swarm optimization algorithm for parameters optimization of the base classifiers. Finally, the results indicate that the average performance of the proposed model is superior to other comparative algorithms as reflected in most evaluation measures for different datasets. It demonstrates that the proposed model is robust and represents a positive development in credit scoring.","","Expert Syst.

"Integration of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms for credit risk assessment","Integrating unsupervised learning with supervised learning at the consensus and dataset clustering stages significantly improves credit risk assessment models.","Wang Bao, Lianju Ning, Kong Yue",2019,91,"Abstract For the sake of credit risk assessment, credit scoring has become a critical tool to discriminate “bad” applicants from “good” applicants for financial institutions. Accordingly, a wide range of supervised machine learning algorithms have been successfully applied to credit scoring; however, integration of unsupervised learning with supervised learning in this field has drawn little consideration. In this work, we propose a combination strategy of integrating unsupervised learning with supervised learning for credit risk assessment. The difference between our work and other previous work on unsupervised integration is that we apply unsupervised learning techniques at two different stages: the consensus stage and dataset clustering stage. Comparisons of model performance are performed based on three credit datasets in four groups: individual models, individual models + consensus model, clustering + individual models, clustering + individual models + consensus model. As a result, integration at either the consensus stage or dataset clustering stage is effective on improving the performance of credit scoring models. Moreover, the combination of the two stages achieves the best performance, thereby confirming the superiority of the proposed integration of unsupervised and supervised machine learning algorithms, which boost our confidence that this strategy can be extended to many other credit datasets from financial institutions.","","Expert Syst.
